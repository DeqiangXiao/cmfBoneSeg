Segmentation of Craniomaxillofacial Bony Structures from MRI with A Cascade Deep Learning Framework

1. extractSsPatch4SegMedImg.py: extracting patches for 1st 3d Unet
2. extractPatches4CNN2.py: extracting pactches for the 2nd context-cnn with uncertainty sampling
3. evalCaffeCMFSeg4MedImg.py: evaluation for the 1st 3d U-Net
4. evalCaffeCMFSegCascade4MedImg.py: evaluation for the 2nd context-cnn
5. infant_train_test_3d.prototxt: the 3d Unet network define file
6. infant_solver_3d.prototxt: the solver file for training the 3d Unet network

I'll update the usage later.
